Predicting the depth of the objects, construct 3D images from 2D images

##DEPTH ESTIMATION

Work is based on 
High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning (arXiv 2018) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11941]

**3D from rgb and depth**
Run either of the notebooks in the 3D Reconstruction directory (one uses o3d and is faster, other is slow and customisable and doesnot require any external library)
